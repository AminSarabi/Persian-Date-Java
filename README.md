# Persian-Date-Java

An easy-to-use and accurate Persian-Gregorian date converter written in java.
Jalali / shamsi / persian / iranian calendar is the official calendar used in iran which is considered by many to be the most accurate calendar
in the world.


## Why use this library?

#### 1. it is accurate in a wide range (from the start of the persian calendar to its 3000th year )

#### 2. does not rely on invalid formulas to determine persian leap years (unlike most libraries)

#### 3. takes into account the 1582 time travel incident

#### 4. efficient calculations (preferring pre-determined low-calculation methods)

#### 5. tested automatically with unit tests

#### 6. Pure java with zero dependencies



### DANGER: this code is not intended to be used for dates out of its supported range (until 3000/1/1 shamsi)
